title:  "Lexical Scoping in R"
author: mohit
---

Lexical Scoping is a feature in R, where the definition of any variable or function is first sought to be located in the place where it is called, if not found there, the language undertakes a hierarchical search for the symbol's definition in the each enveloping environment starting from the most immediate, and ending with the global environment.

This talk will focus on how one can use lexical scoping to write cleaner code, that is more concise and that even runs faster, than comparable code written without the use of this feature.
