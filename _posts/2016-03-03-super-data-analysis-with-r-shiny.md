title:  "Super Data Analysis with R Shiny"
author: patrick
---

Shiny by RStudio levels up your data analysis and consulting work by providing a simple package for transforming your analysis into interactive web-based apps. With little or no experience in web design or JavaScript, any R user can develop and deploy beautiful interactive apps on the web, for use in R studio, or in their R markdown reports. This talk will highlight the key components of a Shiny app including the layout of the user interface, how the user interface interacts with the R server, and how reactive variables work.  This talk will conclude with two examples of how I have used Shiny:

1. To develop an app for Genentechâ€™s statisticians to assist in planning Phase 2 drug trials and,
2. In my consulting work to create an interactive report for my client.
