title:  "Exchangeable Graph Models, Graph Limits, and Graphons"
author: jiasen
---

Recently, nonparametric approaches for modeling relational data based on
exchangeable graph models have been gaining increasing interest.
Relational data are typically encoded in the form of arrays, and the
development of exchangeable graph models relies on a generalization of
de Finetti's theorem to exchangeable arrays due to Aldous and Hoover.
The key object underlying such models is referred to as a graphon, a
notion introduced by Lovász and Szegedy as limits of graph sequences.
This talk will attempt to survey some recent literature on the theory of
exchangeable random graphs and the estimation of graphons, drawing
connections to applications in network analysis such as link prediction,
community detection, and network comparison. The goal of this talk is to
initiate discussions and collaborations on this relatively new topic in
the Purdue statistics community.
