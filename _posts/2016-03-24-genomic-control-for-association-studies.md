title:  "Genomic Control for Association Studies: A Literature Review"
author: will
---

A major spin-off of the Human Genome Project (HGP) is the effort to understand diseases and complex traits in humans using genetic information. Perhaps the most common approach is to utilize case-control studies. Unfortunately, case-control studies may rely upon unrealistic assumptions and may present spurious associations. On a statistical level, the test statistics may be inflated. Genomic Control introduced in 1999 by Devlin and Roeder is one time-tested method of corrective action. I will review this paper in detail and discuss other statistical approaches developed in the last 15 years to advance association studies.
