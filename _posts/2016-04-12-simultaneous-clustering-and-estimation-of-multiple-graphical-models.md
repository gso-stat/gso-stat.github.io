title:  "Simultaneous Clustering and Estimation of Multiple Graphical Models (Upcoming)"
author: botao
---

We consider high dimensional estimation of multiple graphical models arising from heterogeneous observations.
An appealing feature of our methodology is to learn clustering structure while estimating graphical models.
This is achieved via a high dimensional EM algorithm. Meanwhile, a joint graphical lasso penalty is imposed to
extract a common structure shared across all clusters. In theory, a non-asymptotic estimation error bound
is derived for understanding the trade-off between statistical accuracy and computational complexity in
the regularized Gaussian mixture models.
