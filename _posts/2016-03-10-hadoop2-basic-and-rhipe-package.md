In this talk, I will first introduce the basic knowledge of Hadoop, and also the difference between Hadoop1 and Hadoop2 (YARN), and then mainly focus on Hadoop2 with all the terminology and detailed work-flow of a MapReduce Job. The second part of the talk is about the `Rhipe` package in R, i.e. the R and Hadoop Integrated Programming Environment. I will start with a word count example, and then focus more on the unique property of `Rhipe` and what kind of job can be achieved by using it.
